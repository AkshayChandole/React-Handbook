# [Traffic Light SimulationðŸš¦](#traffic-light-simulation)

## **Problem Statement:**  

Design and implement a traffic light system using **React**, where the lights cycle through **red, yellow, and green** at specific time intervals. The traffic light should continuously repeat this cycle **infinitely**.  

**Constraints:**  
- You **cannot** use any external libraries (e.g., state management, animation, or UI libraries).  
- The implementation should be based on **React functional components** and **React's built-in state management (useState, useEffect)**.  
- The color transitions should follow this timing:  
  - **Red:** 5 seconds  
  - **Yellow:** 2 seconds  
  - **Green:** 4 seconds  
- The UI should update dynamically to reflect the active light.  

**Follow-up Questions:**  
1. How would you optimize this solution if the time intervals needed to be dynamically adjustable?  
2. Can you implement this using the **useReducer** hook instead of useState?
