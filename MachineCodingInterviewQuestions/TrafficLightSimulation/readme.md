# [Traffic Light SimulationðŸš¦](#traffic-light-simulation)

## **Problem Statement:**  
Design and develop a traffic light system using **React**, where the lights transition through **red, yellow, and green** in a continuous cycle based on predefined time intervals. The system should function indefinitely, automatically switching between lights at the specified durations.  

### **Constraints:**  
1. **React Functional Components Only** â€“ Use React's built-in **state management (`useState`) and lifecycle management (`useEffect`)** without external state management or animation/UI libraries.  
2. **Fixed Light Durations:**  
   - **Red:** 5 seconds  
   - **Yellow:** 2 seconds  
   - **Green:** 4 seconds  
3. **Real-Time UI Updates** â€“ The displayed light and countdown timer should dynamically reflect the active state.  
4. **Performance Considerations** â€“ The implementation should be efficient and avoid unnecessary re-renders or memory leaks.

### **Follow-up Questions:**  
1. **How can the solution be optimized to allow dynamic time adjustments for each light?**  
2. **Can you implement this system using `useReducer` instead of `useState`?**
