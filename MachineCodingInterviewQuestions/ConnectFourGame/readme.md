# [Connect Four Game](#connect-four-game)

## **Problem Statement:**  
Build a **Connect Four** game, where two players take turns dropping pieces into a grid. A player wins when they connect **four consecutive cells** **horizontally** or **vertically**.  

üïí **Time Constraint:** Solving this in an hour requires strong problem-solving skills and hands-on practice.  

#### üöÄ **Follow-up Challenges:**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Configurable Grid:** Allow customization of the grid size.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Diagonal Wins:** Extend the winning condition to include diagonal connections.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Winning Highlight:** Visually highlight the four winning cells.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Flexible Winning Condition:** Detect any four connected cells using **Disjoint Set (Union-Find)** instead of DFS for efficiency.  

This challenge tests your understanding of **event delegation, state management, CSS, and game logic.** Unlike na√Øve implementations, you **don‚Äôt need an event listener for every grid cell!**  

üí° **Hint for Finding Connected Four Without DFS:** Consider using the **Disjoint Set (Union-Find) data structure** to efficiently track connected components.
