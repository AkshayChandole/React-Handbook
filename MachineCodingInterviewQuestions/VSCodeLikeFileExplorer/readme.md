## Problem Statement
Build a VSCode-inspired File Explorer using React that allows users to manage files and folders in a hierarchical tree structure. The application should support viewing, adding, renaming, and deleting files and folders, similar to the file navigation panel in VSCode.

### Functional Requirements
- **Hierarchical View:** Display files and folders in an expandable and collapsible tree structure.
- **Create Files/Folders:** Users should be able to add new files and folders at any level.
- **Edit Names:** Allow users to rename existing files and folders.
- **Delete Functionality:** Users should be able to remove files and folders. If a folder is deleted, all its contents should be removed as well.
- **Expand/Collapse Folders:** Enable users to expand or collapse folders to manage visibility.
- **Persistent State:** Save the file structure in localStorage so that it remains intact even after a page refresh.

### Technical Constraints
Use only React and CSS for implementation (excluding external libraries, except for icons).

### Bonus Features (Optional)
- **Search Functionality:** Allow users to search for files and folders by name. (implemented in above code)
- **Drag and Drop:** Support rearranging files and folders using a drag-and-drop mechanism.
- **File Preview Panel:** Display the contents of a file when it is selected.
